# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
# Use root/example as user/password credentials

services:

  db:
    image: mysql
    restart: always
    container_name: rubik-mysql
    ports:
      - "3300:3306"
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: 123456

    # (this is just an example, not intended to be a production configuration)
